INTRODUCTION                                    *matchmaker*

This one time I was watching a coworker programming in a big fat IDE and,
between trips to the washroom to throw up, I noticed that it highlighted the 
identifier under his cursor throughout the file so that he could see at a 
glance where it was being used. Enraged at the thought of his IDE having 
useful features that Vim did not, I decided to implement it myself.

COMMANDS                                        *matchmaker-commands*

There's only one command (well, sort of two) and it toggles the behaviour.

                                                *matchmaker-:Matchmaker*
:Matchmaker             Enable matchmaker.

                                                *matchmaker-:Matchmaker!*
:Matchmaker!            Disable matchmaker.

CONFIGURATION                                   *matchmaker-configuration*

No configuration is strictly necessary, but matchmaker can be configured on a 
per-buffer basis by setting the |b:matchmaker_needle()| function; the function 
must return a pattern defining what text matchmaker should highlight.

                                                *matchmaker-needle-example*

As an example, matchmaker's default needle function would look like this: >
    function b:matchmaker_needle()
        return '\V\<'.escape(expand('<cword>'), '\').'\>'
    endfunction
<

                                                *matchmaker-highlight*

Matchmaker defines the "Matchmaker" highlight group, which you can configure 
to your liking. See |:highlight| for how to do that.
